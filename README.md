## Algorithms 𝒲 and ℳ in Agda
Implementation of Hindley-Milner type inference algorithms 𝒲 (Milner 1978) and ℳ (Lee
and Yi 1998). Available for reference as algorithms.

## Notice of Technical Debt

The following are in need of repair.

- I use a named representation (with names ∈ ℕ) under the [Barendregt
  convention](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/69323/barendregts-variable-convention-what-does-it-mean).
  I suspect formalization would not be terribly novel or difficult, but one would
  first need to switch variable representation to either DeBruijn or locally
  nameless (see Charguéraud (2012)). I would recommend locally nameless, as
  algorithms 𝒲 and ℳ require the generation of "new" type variables, which the
  locally nameless style provides via "atoms".
- The [unification algorithm](./agda/Unification) is not structurally recursive, and so requires a TERMINATING pragma.
